# Scriptures Mapped

This has been a valuable learning experience for JavaScript because I could improve my skills using
encapsulation and see how a document could be structured to complete the assignment. While using the videos
was valuable, I also thought it was useful to try doing parts of it on my own and come up wtih my own
solution. This helped me understand what was going on in the code more than just copying the code down.
I added the breadcrumbs on my own, added the buttons for nextChapter/prevChapter on my own, and did some
styling that I wanted. I also got to spend time trying to come up with a solution with the map labels
on my own which didn't turn out the best but I was able to learn through trial and error.
