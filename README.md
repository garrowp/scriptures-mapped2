# Scriptures Mapped

This has been a valuable learning experience for JavaScript because I could improve my skills using
encapsulation and see how a document could be structured to complete the assignment. While using the videos
was valuable, I also thought it was useful to try doing parts of it on my own and come up wtih my own
solution. This helped me understand what was going on in the code more than just copying the code down.
I added the breadcrumbs on my own, added the buttons for nextChapter/prevChapter on my own, and did some
styling that I wanted. I also got to spend time trying to come up with a solution with the map labels
on my own which didn't turn out the best but I was able to learn through trial and error.


For this second part of the project, I've really worked on figuring out how the events play out. I decided
to do the sliding animcations without jQuery and it tooks some time to figure out the best way to do that.
I had to make sure all of the transitions were finished before I could continue in my code. This took some time
to figure out but I imagine that the jQuery animate function is doing something similar in the background.
I also had to solve the problem of the button still being clickable during a transition. I added some checks to
stop the button press event from doing anything if a transition was in progress. I'm sure there are ways to 
refactor and simplify this code but I'm glad that it's working and also that I could change up the CSS to give
it some additional style.
